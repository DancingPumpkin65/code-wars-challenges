# Pangram Checker Algorithm

A **pangram** is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

### Task:
Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return `True` if it is, `False` if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

### Examples:

- `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` → returns `True` because the sentence contains all the letters from A-Z at least once.
- `"Hello World"` → returns `False` because the sentence does not contain all the letters of the alphabet.

### Notes:
- Case is irrelevant (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered the same).
- Ignore numbers and punctuation.

### Function Structure:

```java
public class PangramChecker {
  public boolean check(String sentence) {
    // your code
    return false;
  }
}
```
