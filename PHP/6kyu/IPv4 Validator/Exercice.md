# IPv4 Address Validation Algorithm

Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format. IPv4 addresses should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between 0 and 255, inclusive.

---

## Examples of valid inputs:

- `1.2.3.4`
- `123.45.67.89`

## Invalid input examples:
- `1.2.3`
- `1.2.3.4.5`
- `123.456.78.90`
- `123.045.067.089`

### Notes:
- Leading zeros (e.g. `01.02.03.04`) are considered invalid.
- Inputs are guaranteed to be a single string.

## Function Structure:
```php
function isValidIP(string $str): bool {
    // Code goes here
}
