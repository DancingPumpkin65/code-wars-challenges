# DNA Complement

#### Description:

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all.

#### Example:

```plaintext
Input: "ATTGC"
Output: "TAACG"

Input: "GTAT"
Output: "CATA"
```

### Function Structure:

```php
function DNA_strand($dna) {
  // Code goes here
}
